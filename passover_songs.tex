	On all nights we need not dip even once; on this night we do so twice.\\

% MIRIAM'S SONG %
\song{Miriam's Song}{by Debbie Friedman}

And the women dancing with their timbrels\\
Followed Miriam as she sang her song\\
Sing a song to the One whom we’ve exalted\\
Miriam and the women danced and danced the whole night long.\\
\\
And Miriam was a weaver of unique variety\\
The tapestry she wove was one which sang our history\\
With every strand and every thread she crafted her delight\\
A woman touched with spirit, she dances toward the light.\\
\\
When Miriam stood upon the shores and gazed across the sea\\
The wonder of this miracle she soon came to believe\\
Whoever thought the sea would part with an outstretched hand\\
And we would pass to freedom and march to the promised land.\\
\\
And Miriam the prophet took her timbrel in her hand\\
And all the women followed her just as she had planned\\
And Miriam raised her voice in song, she sang with praise and might:\\
"We’ve just lived through a miracle; we’re going to dance tonight!"\\
